ACSCeND is a cutting-edge computational tool that integrates machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodologies to analyze stem cell data. The tool comprises two key components:

1. ML-based Classifier: This module is designed to classify single-cell transcriptomics data of stem cells into three categories—Pluripotent, Multipotent, and Unipotent—offering insights into stem cell states.

2. DL-based Deconvoluter: This component is used for deconvoluting bulk RNA-seq data to estimate and quantify the cellular compositions within a mixed sample, providing valuable information on the distribution of different cell types.

ACSCeND is the result of a collaborative effort between research groups led by [Prof. Shubhasis Haldar](https://www.shubhasis-haldar-cmt.com/) at the [SN Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences](https://www.bose.res.in/) and [Prof. Debayan Gupta](https://debayangupta.com/) at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/home/). This tool is aimed at advancing research in stem cell biology by leveraging modern computational approaches for more precise and scalable analysis.
